# The Meta-Broker

A simple web application that acts as a "meta-broker" for astrophysics and the study of transients. It allows you to search for a transient by name and provides direct links to view the object across multiple astronomical data brokers.

## Features

- Search for transients by name
- Retrieve coordinates from TNS (Transient Name Server)
- Generate direct links to view the object on multiple brokers:
  - TNS (Transient Name Server)
  - Antares
  - ALeRCE
  - SNAD-Viewer

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Enter a transient name (e.g., "SN 2020oi", or "2020oi")
4. Click "Search"
5. The application will display the object's coordinates and provide links to each broker

## Example Supernovae

Try searching for these transients which have data in the application:
- SN 2020oi
- SN 2023ixf
- SN 2014J
- SN 1987A

## Future Improvements

- Add more astronomical brokers
- Add options to customize the search radius
- Include more details about the supernova from various catalogs
